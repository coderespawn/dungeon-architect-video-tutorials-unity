Introduction
============
Dungeon Architect is a plugin for Unity that helps in streamlining the level creation process. It allows you to quickly create levels procedurally (or manually) by blocking out volumes and having the plugin build the environment automatically around it

Marker Emitters
===============
Marker Emitters emit new markers into the scene.   This gives you a lot of flexibility and the video explores various possibilities

Selection Rule
==============
A selection rule is a behavior script that is used to decide if the current node is to be attached to the scene. This rule replaces the default Probability property that is used for randomly deciding if visual node needs spawning based on a probability.

Transform Rule
===============
Dungeon Architect lets you specify offsets to your visual nodes to move/scale/rotate them from their relative marker locations.

However, if you want a more dynamic way of applying offsets (based on scripts), you can do so with a *Transform Rule*. This can be very useful to add variations to your levels for certain props

Paint Mode
==========
Dungeon Architect allows you to paint your own dungeon layouts with an editor extension. This gives you more artistic control as you are no longer restricted by what the procedural algorithm creates for you

Custom Dungeon Builders
======================
The Default dungeon builder used to create the layout is swappable and you can provide your own implementation

This is useful if you want to use your own algorithm for generating the layout of your dungeons.  You are not limited to a grid based system.
